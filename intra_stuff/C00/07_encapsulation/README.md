# Encapsulation / visibility

Classes in `c++` can have `private` and `public` attributes.

private:

- Can only be accest inside the class itself.
- Should be used to store class internals.
- All atributes should be `private` whenever possible.

public:

- Can be acceses outside the class
- Anyting that's should be rechable by the used belongs here

`Constructors` and `Destructors` can be either `public` or `private` depending on the use case and
class structure.
